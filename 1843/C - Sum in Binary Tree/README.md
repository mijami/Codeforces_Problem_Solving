One day when he was solving another math problem, he came up with an interesting tree. This tree is built as follows.</p><p>Initially, the tree has only one vertex with the number $$$1$$$ — the root of the tree. Then, Vanya adds two children to it, assigning them consecutive numbers — $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, respectively. After that, he will add children to the vertices in increasing order of their numbers, starting from $$$2$$$, assigning their children the minimum unused indices. As a result, Vanya will have an infinite tree with the root in the vertex $$$1$$$, where each vertex will have exactly two children, and the vertex numbers will be arranged sequentially by layers.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/19767bb6961374fcead1e1f59f5391d1b3248808.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   <span class="tex-font-size-small">Part of Vanya's tree.</span> </center><p>Vanya wondered what the sum of the vertex numbers on the path from the vertex with number $$$1$$$ to the vertex with number $$$n$$$ in such a tree is equal to.

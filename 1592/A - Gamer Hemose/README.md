Hemose didn't want to do that, as he was playing Valorant, so he came up with a problem and told it to Ahmed to distract him. Sadly, Ahmed can't solve it... Could you help him?</span></p><p>There is an Agent in Valorant, and he has $$$n$$$ weapons. The $$$i$$$-th weapon has a damage value $$$a_i$$$, and the Agent will face an enemy whose health value is $$$H$$$.</p><p>The Agent will perform one or more moves until the enemy dies.</p><p>In one move, he will choose a weapon and decrease the enemy's health by its damage value. The enemy will die when his health will become less than or equal to $$$0$$$. However, not everything is so easy: <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the Agent can't choose the same weapon for $$$2$$$ times in a row</span>.</p><p>What is the minimum number of times that the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill the enemy?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 10^5)$$$. Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$H$$$ $$$(2 \leq n \leq 10^3, 1 \leq H \leq 10^9)$$$ — the number of available weapons and the initial health value of the enemy.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$$$ — the damage values of the weapons.</p><p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of times that the Agent will have to use the weapons to kill the enemy.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id009819350218475827" id="id0032661683383324225" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id009819350218475827">3

After this, the health of enemy will drop to $$$6-4-2 = 0$$$, meaning he would be killed after using weapons $$$2$$$ times.</p><p>In the third test case, the Agent can use the weapons in order (third, first, third), decreasing the health value of enemy to $$$11 - 7 - 2 - 7 = -5$$$ after using the weapons $$$3$$$ times. Note that we can't kill the enemy by using the third weapon twice, as even though $$$11-7-7 \lt 0$$$, it's not allowed to use the same weapon twice in a row.</p></div>
